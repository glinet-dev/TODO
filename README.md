### Project Description: Todo App using Redux Toolkit and Vite

#### Overview:
The **Todo App** is a simple yet powerful task management application built using modern web development tools and libraries. The app allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) tasks in a clean and intuitive user interface. The project leverages **Redux Toolkit** for state management and **Vite** for a fast and optimized development experience.

#### Key Features:
1. **Task Management:**
   - Add new tasks with a title, description, and due date.
   - Mark tasks as completed or pending.
   - Edit existing tasks to update their details.
   - Delete tasks that are no longer needed.

2. **State Management with Redux Toolkit:**
   - Centralized state management using Redux Toolkit slices.
   - Efficient handling of task-related actions (add, edit, delete, toggle completion).
   - Immutable state updates using Redux Toolkit's `createSlice` and `createReducer`.

3. **Responsive UI:**
   - Clean and minimalistic design for a seamless user experience.
   - Fully responsive layout that works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

4. **Local Storage Integration:**
   - Persist tasks in the browser's local storage to ensure data is retained even after page refresh.

5. **Fast Development with Vite:**
   - Lightning-fast development server and build process using Vite.
   - Optimized for performance with minimal bundle size.

6. **Modern JavaScript and React:**
   - Built using React functional components and hooks.
   - Utilizes modern ES6+ features for cleaner and more maintainable code.

#### Technologies Used:
- **Frontend Framework:** React
- **State Management:** Redux Toolkit
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **Styling:** CSS Modules or a CSS-in-JS library (e.g., styled-components)
- **Routing:** React Router (optional, if multi-page features are added)
- **Local Storage:** For persisting tasks

```

#### How to Run the Project:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-app.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd todo-app
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

#### Future Enhancements:
- Add user authentication to allow multiple users to manage their own tasks.
- Integrate a backend API for persistent storage and synchronization across devices.
- Implement task categorization (e.g., work, personal, shopping).
- Add due date reminders and notifications.

#### Conclusion:
This Todo App project is an excellent opportunity to learn and practice modern web development techniques, including state management with Redux Toolkit, efficient builds with Vite, and responsive UI design. It serves as a foundation for building more complex applications in the future.
