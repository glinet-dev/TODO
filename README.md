# TODO
The Todo App is a simple yet powerful task management application built using modern web development tools and libraries. The app allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) tasks in a clean and intuitive user interface. The project leverages Redux Toolkit for state management and Vite for a fast and optimized development experience.
